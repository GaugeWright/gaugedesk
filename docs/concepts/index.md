# How GaugeDesk works

You do not need these concepts to complete your first run. Use this section
when you need to understand a permission, review, or deployment.

## The basic workflow

1. Build or select one fixed agent version.
2. Add it to a project.
3. Allow the files and tools needed for one run.
4. Run the agent.
5. Review the proposed changes.
6. Keep, discard, or release the result.

## Agent instructions and project work are separate

Use an edit chat to change an agent. Use a work chat to use the agent on project
files. A project file or work prompt cannot silently rewrite the agent.

## Permission is explicit

An agent does not receive access only because it knows a file name or has a
tool installed. GaugeDesk checks the exact file, tool, action, purpose, and
current approval.

If required permission is missing or invalid, GaugeDesk denies the action.

## Review comes before acceptance

Agent output is proposed work. A person reviews it before keeping it. Sending
content to another person or system can require a separate release review.

## Fixed versions make work repeatable

A saved version cannot change. A project or website session uses one exact
version until an authorized person selects another version.

## Where work runs matters

Local, hosted, and independently verified runtimes have different trust limits.
The model provider still receives prompts and allowed context in plaintext.

[How GaugeDesk protects your work](protection.md).
