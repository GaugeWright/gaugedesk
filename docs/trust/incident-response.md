# Incident response

GaugeWright's incident process:

1. Assign an owner and identify affected services, accounts, data, and time.
2. Contain the smallest affected boundary by revoking access, disabling a
   deployment or route, isolating a host, or stopping a service.
3. Preserve audit history and security-event metadata.
4. Remove the cause and verify the original path now fails closed.
5. Restore from known-good state when needed, verify audit and monitoring
   health, and confirm revoked access remains revoked.
6. Notify affected customers under the applicable agreement, DPA, and law.
7. Record the timeline, cause, scope, response, notifications, and control
   changes in their owning systems.

Internal recovery targets are 24-hour RPO and 8-hour RTO, not a customer SLA.
Customer payload must not be copied into ordinary tickets.

Report incidents through [Support](support.md). If a subprocessor is involved,
GaugeWright follows its incident process and updates the
[subprocessor list](subprocessors.md) when the operating facts change.
