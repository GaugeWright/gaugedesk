# Frequently asked questions

## Does the model run on my computer?

No. GaugeDesk runs project controls locally, but the selected provider receives
the prompt and allowed context in plaintext. Local model inference is not
supported.

## What can I use now?

The desktop workbench supports local build, run, and review. See
[Product status](reference/status.md) for hosted, team, enterprise, mobile, and
website capabilities.

## Why was an action denied?

The run lacked permission for a file, tool, network route, or output. Inspect
the requested action before granting more access. See
[Troubleshooting](guides/expert/troubleshooting.md).

## Can I publish an agent on a website?

Theory A is a live production proof, but general self-service is not available.
Contact GaugeWright before promising this feature. Publication creates a fixed
hosted release; the author's computer does not serve visitors. Existing
sessions remain on their starting release after an update.

## Can a website agent return a result?

Yes, when the release fixes the eligible content, schema, recipient, and size.
Downloaded results are encrypted and quarantined for review.

## Who can see plaintext?

- Local work: the computer owner and model provider.
- Another system: that system's operator and model provider.
- Website agent: GaugeWright's runtime and model provider.

The encrypted transfer relay cannot read content.

## Can an agent change its instructions?

Not in a work chat. Edit chats change drafts. Linux and macOS also enforce this
separation with an operating-system sandbox; Windows does not.

## Can I block network access?

Yes, but a fully isolated run cannot call a remote model. Some hosts can allow
only the selected provider; others show the lower, unfiltered protection level.

## What independent assurance exists?

GaugeWright has no completed penetration test, SOC 2 report, ISO 27001
certification, or uptime SLA. Internal tests and formal models are not
independent assurance.

## What are the license and price?

The GaugeDesk platform, including Administration, is AGPL-3.0-only with narrow
permissions for independent public-interface extensions and the unmodified embed
client. The two client SDK packages are Apache-2.0. Commercial licenses are
available from GaugeWright LLC for non-AGPL use. GaugeDesk Plus is defined at USD
12 per seat monthly; custom work and other services are separate.

## How do I get help or request a DPA?

See [Support](trust/support.md) and the
[subprocessor list](trust/subprocessors.md).
